# Reproduce Boost decision tree, please see boosted_decision_tree.ipynb, I run it on my computer

# Reproduce SVM, I implement my SVM and sklearn SVM. For sklearn SVM, please see svm.ipynb. I set two kernels, linear and rbf.

# For My SVM, please run the command below. Please see SVMClassifier.py and SVM.py
python3 SVM.py
# For K-means, please run k_means.py.
